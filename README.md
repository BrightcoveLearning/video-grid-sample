# Video Grid Sample

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/team/rcrooks1969/pen/ZEQNoLa](https://codepen.io/team/rcrooks1969/pen/ZEQNoLa).

In this sample, you will learn how to use the Playback API to retrieve a group of videos by ID, display them in a grid, and launch videos in a player when the user clicks on a thumbnail - in other words, build a simple video portal.

This repository contains all the code for your convenience. There are both `src` and `dist` folders, but their contents are identical. We recommend you use the `dist` folder if you want to modify the code, so that you still have the original source.
